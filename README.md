# personalWebsite
This repository is where I develop and deploy my personal website. The websites acts as a project portfolio, online resume, and hub for all web based stuff I make. 
All the code is original with 2 exceptions. 
Exception 1 - In gradCounter.js the jquery utilizing the day.js library I copied code for my grad countdown timer from this youtube tutorial Link here.
Exception 2 - In stateEffects.js most of the code is modified from this tutorial link here for my svg travel map on travel.html.
