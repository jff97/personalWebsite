# My Personal Website 
This website is deployed at www.johnfoxweb.com

This repository is where I develop and deploy my personal website. The websites acts as a project portfolio, online resume, and hub for all web based stuff I make. 

All the code is original with 2 exceptions. 

Exception 1 - In gradCounter.js the jquery utilizing the day.js library I copied code for my grad countdown timer from this youtube tutorial [countdown timer tutorial](https://youtu.be/Zr2kBYzcJ14)

Exception 2 - In stateEffects.js most of the code is modified from this tutorial [us map tutorial](https://websitebeaver.com/how-to-make-an-interactive-and-responsive-svg-map-of-us-states-capitals) for my svg travel map on travel.html.

Exception 3 - In my R-Tree project sometimes my fast algorithm didnt work to fit the smallest circle for 2 shapes. So in those rare cases I used a slower but more through algorithm from (https://www.nayuki.io/page/smallest-enclosing-circle)
